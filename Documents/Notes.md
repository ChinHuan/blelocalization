# Notes

## Decisions

- Classification or Regression
- GroupBy or Rolling
  - For small amount of data, rolling is better as more data is remained
- Forward fill or not
- Imputation with 0 or -100
- Scaling (No scaling, MinMaxScaling, StandardScaling ...)

## Error Analysis

- Identify what are the possible causes of the errors

## Separability

- Analyse histogram separation
  - For each scanner, analyse the distribution of RSSI for each location

## Time Series Analysis

- Moving average
- Exponential smoothing
- ARIMA

## Visualisation

- Identify possible visualisation to explore the data
